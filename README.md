# Social Network API 📱

## Description 📝

This is an API backend for a social network application called "BootCamp Hub" - a network where bootcamp students can share their thoughts, have a friends list, and react to their friends' thoughts all in one place.

The primary goal was to create this API using a NoSQL database - in this case, we used `MongoDB`. This application utilizes `Express.js` for routing, `Mongoose` to handle our database schema and connection, the `Moment.js` module for date formatting, and `Insomnia` for seeding and testing our application and its routes.

### User Story 👨‍💻

- As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL datatbase so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
